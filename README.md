## Description

RemoSharp is a Grasshopper plugin for real-time (RT) and non-real-time (NRT) collaborative computational design and fabrication.
In a nutshell, RemoSharp allows multiple Grasshopper documents to connect and share their scripts. Let's imagine Google Docs or Miro, but for Grasshopper.

### Real-Time Collaboration
RemoSharp syncronizes the contents of one's GH canvas via a RT communication server. Interactions like component creation, wire connection, deletion, or moving components around are all syncrinized between multiple connected computers, resulting in a RT collaborative Grasshopper session.

### Non-Real-Time 
Not all collaborations need to be in RT. RemoSharp provides the RemoLibrary GH database. Users can save their small function snippets or their entire scripts to the RemoLibrary. The database offers an interface to search, and modify these entries. It also activley monitors one's grasshopper interactions and suggests functions from the database accordingly.

A Tool for Remote Collaboration in Architecture and Computational Design.
RemoSharp is a Tool for Remote/Local Real-Time Collaboration.
It is made out of two major parts:
1. programming in GH from text inputs that can come from anywhere in the world
2. Visual Programming by broadcasting a computer's GH canvas for all clients

Collaborations to improve RemoSharp is very much appreciated!
