## Description

RemoSharp is a Grasshopper plugin for real-time (RT) and non-real-time (NRT) collaborative computational design and fabrication.
In a nutshell, RemoSharp allows multiple Grasshopper documents to connect and share their scripts. Let's imagine Google Docs or Miro, but for Grasshopper.

### Real-Time Collaboration
RemoSharp syncronizes the contents of one's GH canvas via a RT communication server. Interactions like component creation, wire connection, deletion, or moving components around are all syncrinized between multiple connected computers, resulting in a RT collaborative Grasshopper session.

### Non-Real-Time 
Not all collaborations need to be in RT. RemoSharp provides the RemoLibrary GH database. Users can save their small function snippets or their entire scripts to the RemoLibrary. The database offers an interface to search, and modify these entries. It also activley monitors one's grasshopper interactions and suggests functions from the database accordingly.

A Tool for Remote Collaboration in Architecture and Computational Design.
RemoSharp is a Tool for Remote/Local Real-Time Collaboration.
It is made out of two major parts:
1. programming in GH from text inputs that can come from anywhere in the world
2. Visual Programming by broadcasting a computer's GH canvas for all clients

Collaborations to improve RemoSharp is very much appreciated!

A big thank you to my main advisor, Prof. Yasushi Ikeda, for his incredible guidance and encouragement throughout this project. Thanks to Prof. Shohei Matsukawa and Prof. Hiroto Kobayashi for their fantastic support and feedback.

Special thanks to Dr. Jose Luis Garcia del Castillo y Lopez for his guidance and to his YouTube Channel “ParametricCamp” for being a continuous source of learning.

I am grateful to Dr. Kensuke Hotta, my colleagues and friends at Syntegrate Japan and Vicc Ltd., and Mr. Kenji Watanabe for their feedback and support.

Shoutouts to my friends from Ikeda-Lab at Keio University SFC and The University of Tokyo: Taisei Yabe, Xuanyu Lu, Chika Sukegawa, Serena Ito, Koki Ito, and Shun Kimura, as well as the Kobayashi-Lab and Matsukawa-Lab students.

Thank you, Behrooz Tahanzadeh and Ali Torabi, for your open-source developments, and Junichiro Horikawa for your inspiring YouTube tutorials about Grasshopper. Behrooz's Websocket Components, while no longer used by RemoSharp, were instrumental in developing the early version of this software. Ali Torabi's GH_CustomControl library is a great contributing factor to RemoSharp's development and functions.
