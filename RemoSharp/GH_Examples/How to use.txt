How to use:
1. Run the Local WebSocket Server.exe file from the Local WebSocket Server folder (make sure both dll files are beside the .exe file)
2. Open the Grasshopper Example file
3. connect the two points beside the generated C# component on the Top-Left Corner of the GH Canvas

The Created Polyline is being generated from the direct inputs of the C# component, and the values being sent 
via WS communication to the local server and received by the WS listener.
